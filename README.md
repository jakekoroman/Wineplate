# Wineplate

Wineplate creates template scripts for launching games through wine. You can use any wine version you like just put it into the config file.

Note that some games will not work out of the box and will require some tinkering.

## Configuration

All configuration is done through the config.h file. All the macros have the same name as the variable they are setting making it easy to look up what each one does.

## Building 

Simply run
```console
make
```

## Notes

This is just a template generator. Most games I've tested have worked out of the box but there are edge cases!
